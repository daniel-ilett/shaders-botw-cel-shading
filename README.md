## Overview

A cel-shaded aesthetic can help make your game visually distinct from other styles like photorealism. This effect uses Shader Graph with some custom lighting code to tweak Unity's lighting so that it appears cel-shaded.

## Software

This project was created using Unity 2020.2.1f1 and Universal Render Pipeline 10.2.2.

## Authors

This project and the corresponding tutorial was created by Daniel Ilett.
